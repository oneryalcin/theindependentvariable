2014 yılından bu yana Reading/İngiltere'de yaşıyorum ve Sky firmasında (Network) Veri Bilimcisi olarak çalışıyorum. Bu kişisel blogumda hem Türkçe hem de İngilizce paylaşımlarda bulunmaya çalışacağım. Veri 

I'm a (Network) Data Scientist and a father of two from Reading/UK and working for Sky UK currently. I'm living in UK however I grew up un Turkey so I sometimes also post in Turkish as there is not much of data science content produced in Turkish. 

There are thousands of Data Science blogs and this one is not very different; I'd like to share few of my experiences, technical tips, few interesting stories that you may find useful or fun at some point. I read other people's blog a lot and learned also a lot from them. This is a small give back to the community. 

Even though I identify myself as Data Scientist,  I do also considerable amount of full-stack web dev, and DevOps, to create analytics pipelines. 

I very much enjoy probability theory, so I'm planning to post many probabilty and stats related posts, mostly using computational approach.

My background is Network Engineering. Therefore it's not a surprise that few of my posts focus on details of Network engineering, internet measurements etc...
